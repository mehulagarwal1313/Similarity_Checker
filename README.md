# Similarity_Checker
This project is a Python-based application designed to analyze and cluster programming code files based on their similarity. It leverages advanced text similarity algorithms, AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) visualization, and graph-based representations to group similar approaches, identify outliers, and highlight innovative coding patterns.
